      <p>
        I'm a grade 12 student, striving to design stunning, functional, and
        meaningful projects. I create self-initiated works to consistently
        sharpen my skills, and always aim to see every situation as a learning
        opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        With my abilities and experience, I also strive to prove the competence
        of today's young people and inspire zealous learners like me to aim for
        excellence.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not designing, I'm likely to be watching educational videos,
        listening to podcasts, reading a book, and taking online courses for
        skill improvement or personal development.
